Likewise, at initial sync gain time, should it go "prelim sync found" and only verify sync on the second lap around, or start firing events straight off the bat. Starting will suck if paranoid, but if there is noise at high load/rpm and events get mis-scheduled before sync is lost, that is serious. This is philosophical, and the reality is that you must assume that your signal is clean to some level and verified clean under lower risk conditions.
